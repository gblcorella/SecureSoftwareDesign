Pick something cool (that you think I will think is cool) that someone else has coded into a C/C++ library on github. Figure out how to get me a repl.it where that C/C++ library is included so when I hit run I experience the coolness. (mastery skill: configuring and installing 3rd party content (bonus skill: doing it in a constrained environment)) (this is real life)
