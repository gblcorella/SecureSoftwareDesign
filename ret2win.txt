Ret2Win Notes and Ideas:
	Object dump and find out there is a ret2win func()
	- objdump -d ret2win
	- Get the offset and address we want to return to
	- ret2win location: 0804862c

Instruction point got flooded with 4 bytes. Figure out buffer for 32 and 64 bit to send with payload. Then our payload should work? 

payload = address + (offset * (b'a'))
